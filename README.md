Our interactive dashboard lets you peek into the heart of our testing process:
- Progress bars for each STLC stage within each project: See how each project is faring at a glance.
- Test case execution results: Dive into pass/fail/skip stats with clear visualizations.
- Defect trends and severity: Track issues and prioritize fixes effectively.
- Code coverage metrics: Where applicable, measure how thoroughly your code is being tested.
